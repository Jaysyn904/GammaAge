Cyborgs are stock humans that have for various reasons, been fitted with one or more cybernetic implants early on in their lives.  Like regular stock humans, most are very similar to ancient humans with the major exception of directly interfacing their bodies with one or more machines.  However, cyborgs on Gamma Terra can run a huge range of sizes and appearances, from the lucky scavenger that finds an ancient but unobtrusive nightvision cybereye self-installation kit to disembodied brains eternally piloting war machines capable of leveling entire cities.
