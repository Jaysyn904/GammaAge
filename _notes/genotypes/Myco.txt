Sentient plants, or greenfolk, are a wondrous new life form. Mobile and sometimes ferocious, they have the ability to think and reason and can carry unusual mutations. They can be fearsome opponents and valued allies. Generally, looking like their plant ancestor they can uproot themselves to move and all Gamma Age player character greenfolk have the ability to manipulate their surroundings and can communicate verbally and sometimes even telepathically.  Greenfolk that are decended from fungus & lichens are called mycos.  They are tough and hardy with a penchant for surviving where other creatures can't.  Mycos have a generally alien mindset, even in regards to other greenfolk.
