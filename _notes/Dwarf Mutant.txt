`The most numerous sub-group, are the result of random genetic accidents that occur because of the biotech soup floating in the air and water, the background radiation left over from the Final Wars’ final volleys, and the desperate attempts by nature to put things right. Degenerate humans, elevated animals and hybrids between the two: No two true mutants are alike. Most true mutants die shortly after birth, their bodies so twisted by defects that they cannot survive. Other true mutants are those who have been blessed even as they have been cursed, whose defects do not overwhelm their advantages.  Mutant Dwarfs are much smaller and weaker than normal humans and other mutants but are quicker & more agile.

Mutant Dwarf Ability Adjustments: -2 STR, +2 DEX

Special Abilities:

- Small: As Small creature, a Mutant Dwarf gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks, but are unable to use large weapons such as scythes, polearms & some high-tech heavy weapons. 
- Mutant Dwarf base land speed is 20 feet.
- Mutations: Mutant characters begin with 3 minor positive mutations, 1 major positive mutation and 1 minor negative mutation.  Choose the positive mutations, and then roll for the negative one.
- Genetic Instability: Mutants of all sorts suffer from genetic instability.  All mutant characters suffer a –2 penalty on all saves against developing new mutations (such as when exposed to environmental mutagens.  This penalty increases by –1 for every two character levels (for example, a 2nd-level mutant suffers a –3 to her save against mutation).
- Spontaneous Mutation: The biochemical soup that makes up much of Gamma Terra's environment can produce random effects on mutant characters. Whenever a mutant character gains a class level or is knocked down to 0
or fewer hit points, the character must make a Fortitude save as if the character had encountered a mild mutagen or gain a new mutation. Moreaus and humans do not spontaneously mutate in this fashion.`
