Perform

Requires Training: Yes.

The character is accomplished in some type of artistic expression and knows how to put on a performance. The character can impress audiences with his or her talent and skill. The quality of the character’s performance depends on his or her check result.

Result 	Performance
10 		Amateur performance. Audience may appreciate your performance, but isn’t impressed.
15 		Routine performance. Audience enjoys your performance, but it isn’t exceptional.
20 		Great performance. Audience highly impressed.
25 		Memorable performance. Audience enthusiastic.
30 		Masterful performance. Audience awed.

Try Again?: Not for the same performance and audience.

Special: A character can take 10 when making a Perform check, but can’t take 20.

A character without an appropriate instrument automatically fails any check he or she attempts. At the GM’s discretion, impromptu instruments may be employed, but the performer must take a –4 penalty on the check because his or her equipment, although usable, is inappropriate for the skill.

Time: A Perform check usually requires at least several minutes to an hour or more.
