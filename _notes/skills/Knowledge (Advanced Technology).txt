Knowledge (Advanced Technology)

Ability: Intelligence.
Requires Training: Yes.

Check: A character makes a Knowledge check to see if the character knows something.

The DC for answering a question within the characterâ€™s field of study is 10 for easy questions, 15 for basic questions, and 20 to 30 for tough questions.

The technological leaps that came out of the Final Wars, before the implosion of civilization, are considered advanced technology. Robotics, artificial intelligence, energy weaponry, antigravity, force fields and even teleportation all appeared during this era. Note that neither nanotechnology nor biotechnology are covered by Knowledge (Advanced Technology); nanotechnology has its own skill, while biotechnology falls under Knowledge (Life Sciences).

NOTE: This skill supplants & functions as the Lore skill for most unidentified items.
