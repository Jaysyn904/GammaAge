Craft (Mechanical)

Ability: Intelligence.
Requires Training: Yes.

This skill allows a character to build mechanical devices from scratch, including engines and engine parts, weapons, armor, and other gadgets. When building a mechanical device from scratch, the character describes the kind of device he or she wants to construct; then the Gamemaster decides if the device is simple, moderate, complex, or advanced compared to current technology.

The character using this skill can combine raw components to form various trap kits. There is a 10% chance on any failed skill roll that the components are lost, even though a trap was not crafted.

Check: The DC is determined by the type of trap being created. The more powerful the trap, the more difficult it is to build and the more components it requires.

Special: A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a â€“4 penalty on Craft (Mechanical) checks.
