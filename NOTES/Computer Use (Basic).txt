Computer Use (Basic)

Ability: Intelligence.
Requires Training: Yes.

This skill encompasses the use of computer systems designed to store information and those designed to run external systems (such as weapons or remote robots).  Data is recorded on various media, either internal or external, and is accessible only usingspecific kinds of hardware. With this skill, a character can find data that has been hidden, encoded, deleted or even physically destroyed, given enough time and skill.

The following table lists DCs for retrieving data from a computer system:

DC     Example Data
10     Data is kept on a non-secure computer.
20     Data is kept on a system with minimum security.
25     Data is kept on a system with average security.
35     Data is kept on a system with exceptional security.
40     Data is kept on a system with maximum security.
+5     The computer system has been damaged.
+5     The data was erased using conventional methods.
+10    The data is encrypted and the character failed a Decipher Script skill check.
+10    The data was erased using advanced methods, such as an EMP blast.


In addition to modifying and retrieving data from a system, the character may attempt to take control of the system and its remote components.  The DC for entering the system is based on the security level of the system, as described above.  Once in the system, the character must make a second Computer Use (data and operation systems) check to modify commands sent to remote components.

DC    Example Command
5     Begin or cease normal operations
10    Delay the start or end of normal operations by a small amount of time (10% of the time of the normal operations), with a minimum of 10 minutes.
15    Stop operations in mid-cycle.
20    Override security or safety protocols.
30    Self-destruct.
