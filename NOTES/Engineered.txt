You are one of the "Engineered" a sentient, genetically uplifted animal or a species that may or may not have been driven to extinction in the centuries after the Final Wars.  The Engineered are some of the most common mutants on Gamma Terra, and the most likely to breed true and create communities of their own. Final Wars era scientists designed these “moreaus” primarily as living weapons and hyper-specialized workers and soldiers, though some breeds were made for entertainment, pleasure and experimentation.
