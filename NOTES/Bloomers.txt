Sentient plants, or greenfolk, are a wondrous new life form. Mobile and sometimes ferocious, they have the ability to think and reason and can carry unusual mutations. They can be fearsome opponents and valued allies. Generally, looking like their plant ancestor they can uproot themselves to move and all Gamma Age player character greenfolk have the ability to manipulate their surroundings and can communicate verbally and sometimes even telepathically.  Flowering greenfolk are known as bloomers.  As being generally attractive to most other creatures on Gamma Terra isn't always a good thing, bloomers are able to subtlety effect other sentient creatures via their pheromone-like pollen.
