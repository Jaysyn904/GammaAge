Civilization is the act of imposing order on the chaos of the wilderness. Enforcers are the strong arm of order, the warriors who defend civilization. Of course, definitions of civilization vary. Enforcers stand atop the walls of forts, holding the line against the ark barbarians besieging the outpost. However, enforcers can also be found amid the barbarians below. The ark chieftain and his best warriors are enforcers, keeping order in the tribe. Enforcers are the thugs, the guards, the defenders and the hunters of violent Gamma Terra. They are more than simple fighters; they are community leaders and skilled soldiers.
