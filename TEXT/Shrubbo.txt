Sentient plants, or greenfolk, are a wondrous new life form. Mobile and sometimes ferocious, they have the ability to think and reason and can carry unusual mutations. They can be fearsome opponents and valued allies. Generally, looking like their plant ancestor they can uproot themselves to move and all Gamma Age player character greenfolk have the ability to manipulate their surroundings and can communicate verbally and sometimes even telepathically.  Bush-like greenfolk are known as shrubbos.  They are generally agile & have no trouble blending in with both natural & urban environments.
