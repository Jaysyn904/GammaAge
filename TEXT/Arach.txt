The Engineered are some of the most common mutants on Gamma Terra, and the most likely to breed true and create communities of their own. Final Wars era scientists designed these “moreaus” primarily as living weapons and hyper-specialized workers and soldiers, though some breeds were made for entertainment, pleasure and experimentation.  Whatever a particular strain’s origins, many of them escaped into the wild during or  immediately following the Final Wars and not only survived, but prospered.  Almost any higher animal imaginable, and a few fish & invertibrates, have been elevated to this man-like status, and to varying degrees.  "Arach" is a catch-all term to describe engineered mutants that have a spider, scorpion or similar arachnid as their genetic progenitor.
